INSTALLATION/USE

Simply copy the 'MakeF1GreatAgain1' folder into your 'EasyERPMod/_MODS' folder.
Run the executable file 'ERPLoader' and wait for it to launch your game.
By the way, don't close 'ERPLoader'... it will close itself after closing the game.

MODULAR MODS

Not gonna happen, MM doesn't currently support some of the ai changes I made (to my knowledge).
